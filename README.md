# Data_Analyst_Projects

## Objective
The first project organizes a company's customer table and analyzes a certain customer, such as total, maximum and minimum expenditure on a product. We filter the customer table by age, monthly earnings and which ones purchased those specific products.

The second project, in Step 1, I provided an overview of the data and wrote my observations. In Step 2, I preprocessed the data by cleaning it. Finally, in Step 3, I tested the hypothesis by taking the necessary programming steps to test each statement and commented on the results in the appropriate blocks.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Final Results
- In the Project 1, the analysis revealed that, in the city of Springfield, there is a significantly higher rate of music consumption compared to Shelbyville. Additionally, it was observed that the streaming application experiences a notable increase in usage on Mondays and Fridays.
- The Project 2, the analysis showed that only 20% of customers are under 30 years old and have a monthly expense greater than $1000.00
