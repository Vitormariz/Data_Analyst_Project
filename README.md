# Data_Analyst_Project
Project 1: Basic Python and Project 2: Data Pre Processing

Welcome to my project repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects focused on basic Python programming, data preprocessing, and data visualization. These projects include an inventory management system, data cleaning techniques, and a dashboard showcasing COVID-19 vaccine research across select countries. The dashboard provides insights into vaccination rates and trends, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the global vaccination effort. Explore the code to see practical examples of how Python and data visualization can be applied to real-world problems!
